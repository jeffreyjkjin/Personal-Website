    "As a kid, the two things I loved to do the most were playing with computers and making things. Now I'm trying to do them for a living as I work towards becoming a software engineer. I'm currently a third-year computing science major at Simon Fraser University. I am passionate about building high-quality software; I love being involved all throughout a project during the development process, from prototyping to implementing user stories to quality assurance. My previous works include developing video games and websites, simulating computer architecture, and optimizing machine learning models."
