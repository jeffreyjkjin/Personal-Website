    "Hello friends, my name is Jeffrey Jin.",
    "I'm a software developer.",
    "That means I solve problems.",
    "Not questions such as 'Are we living in a simulation?' since this can be proven trivially by the existence of Florida or Kanye West.",
    "I solve practical problems by building great software by adhering to the fundamentals of software engineering as well as adding the tried-and-true catalyst composed of blood, sweat, and most importantly, tears, to ensure my products effectively satisfy a user's needs and wants.",
    "So remember, when you want to win, you better call Jin!"
