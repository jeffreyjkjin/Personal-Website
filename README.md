# My Personal Website
![Website GIF](/public/personalsite.gif)

This is the repo for my personal website/portfolio that I use to showcase my projects. I created this site so I could learn web design and development. It is was built using [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), [React](https://react.dev/), and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). The website deployed on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) and runs using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
